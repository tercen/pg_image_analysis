1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 7.13.   

. If the MCR is not installed, run MCRInstaller.exe, located in:

  <mcr_root>*\toolbox\compiler\deploy\win32\MCRInstaller.exe

For more information on the MCR Installer, see the MATLAB Compiler 
documentation.  


2. Files to Deploy and Package

3. Definitions

MCR - MATLAB Builder NE uses the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR), 
which is a standalone set of shared libraries that enable the execution 
of M-files. The MCR provides complete support for all features of 
MATLAB without the MATLAB GUI. When you package and distribute an 
application to users, you include supporting files generated by the 
builder as well as the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR). If necessary, 
run MCRInstaller.exe to install version 7.13 of MCR. For more 
information about the MCR, see the MATLAB Compiler documentation.




* NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed on the target machine.
